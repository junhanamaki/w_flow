WFlow aims to help on designing workflows based on [Single
Responsibility Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle). WFlow
proposes to achieve this by providing tools to build classes where each are responsible for a task
and one task only, and by providing tools to compose these classes.

Word of appreciation for [usecasing](https://github.com/tdantas/usecasing),
[interactor](https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor) and
[rest_my_case](https://github.com/goncalvesjoao/rest_my_case) that served as
inspiration for this gem.

## Dependencies

Tested with:

  * ruby 2.2.1, 2.2.0, 2.1.1, 2.0.0

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'w_flow'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install w_flow

## Usage

On its most simplest form a task (in WFlow called a Process) is something like this:

```ruby
class SaveUser
  include WFlow::Process

  def perform
    # arguments passed to run will be under flow.data
    flow.data.user.save
  end
end

# run process, it will return a report object
report = SaveUser.run(user: current_user)

report.data.success?
```
